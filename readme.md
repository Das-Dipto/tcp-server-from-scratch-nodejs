# TCP Server from Scratch (Node.js)
This repository is a learning-by-doing project focused on understanding **TCP servers at a low level** by building one from scratch using **raw Node.js sockets**.
> No Express  
> No HTTP  
> No frameworks  
> Just real TCP

## Goals
- Understand how TCP servers actually work
- Learn socket-based communication
- Design a simple TCP protocol
- Handle multiple clients
- Deal with partial messages and buffering
- Build confidence with low-level backend concepts

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Built-in `net` module
- JavaScript (no frameworks)

## Project Structure (planned)
```
/src
  server.js
  client.js
/notes
  tcp-basics.md
  protocol-design.md
README.md
```

## Learning Approach
This project is built **step by step**, focusing on understanding *why* things work, not just *how*.  
Each step builds on the previous one.
